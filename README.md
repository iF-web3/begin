The main goal of this project is to _compete_ with the world economy using the currency of the world — The United States Dollar. This competition is a conseuqnce of the want for a global community, singularly purposed with actualising each member of the community. Technological progress has always first benefitted the few (the inventors, the funders, etc.), and then found a way to reach the masses. Note that _technology_ is used very liberally here in that language is also a human technology to express ideas and thought.

Computers (and its theoretical counterpart, computing) provided humanity with _universal machines_, from its inception in the mind to increasingly ubiquitious presence in society (Raspberry Pi is a full fledged computer for under 50 USD!). These universal machines are amazing for many reasons, the first and foremost being their universal nature. This is made most tangible recently by the _scourge_ of the internet, where the universal machines became universally connected and the humans could not keep up. Humanity could though, and we now have web3 — a combination of semantic understanding of the chaotic information along with incentives to understand that information _appropriately_.

This project aims to harness the incentivisation schemes and the interest in such, fresh in the public mind [read: cache], to _orient_ humanity back towards a mindset of exploration — of self, of humanity, and of the universe! As such, this project also follows the `mind, body, soul` structure throughout (along with other nerdy puns and patterns) wherein the `mind` represents the self, the individual, the thoughts, etc. , the `body` represents the reality, the community, the perception, etc. , and the `soul` represents the universe, the world, the legacy, etc.


## The Network Protocol

Effectively, the [protocol](https://github.com/thisispalash/tampopo) borrows ideas heavily from domains of math, computing, and physics. From math, it primarily borrows number theory and linear algebra, and with logic and proofs; from computing it borrows the idea(s) of cryptography, binary systems, and algorithms; and from physics [read: quanitum information] it borrows the concepts of bloch spheres, observation, and entanglement. Furthermore, if we add some statistics into the mix, we can do some interesting stuff with _articicial_ intelligence and _quantum_ hardware to _transcend_ into the universe (heaven, space travel, or legacy).

The base building block in this _universe_ or _network_ is `uint8` or unsigned integer with 8 bits or 1 byte. The information is encoded on a bloch sphere, a unit sphere, which can be represented by two angles — `θ` the angle from positive _orientation_, and `ø` the angle on the plane (from positive _x axis_, if plane is _x-y_). Hence, there are two inherent constraints — `θ ∈ [0,π]` and `ø ∈ [0,2π]`. Since `π = 180°`, the first angle can be encoded using 1 byte or `unint8` by using the most significant bit of the byte to represent positive or negative _orientation_ (the control), and the remaining 7 bits can be used to store upto `π/2` (and slightly beyond).

The first struct in the network then becomes a ___qbit___, which holds the two angles (and thus requires 3 bytes). The next struct is an axis which holds two qbits. Then, two axes and (a pointer to) an orientation becomes a token. The first _custom_ struct, the object, is a token with (a pointer to) object type and some meta bits. The next comes a path which holds two objects, a (pointer to) proof of _travel_, and some meta bits. Finally come the non fungible tokens and the semi fungible tokens, the nft holding the path, a pointer to the mining entity, meta bits, and data bytes while the sft holds the nft, pointers to the mining entity and sft mechanics, meta and option bits, and data bytes.
